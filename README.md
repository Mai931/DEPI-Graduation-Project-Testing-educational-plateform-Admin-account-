## ITC-College Website Admin Account Testing

### Project Overview

This project focuses on testing the admin account of the **ITC-College website**, an educational platform designed to manage various academic and administrative functions. The platform facilitates tasks such as handling student records, academic materials, exams, leave management, and staff communications.

### Objectives

- Ensure the stability, functionality, and performance of the admin account.
- Validate core features critical to the platform's operation.
- Conduct API testing to ensure reliable and accurate API responses.
- Perform performance testing to evaluate scalability and identify potential bottlenecks.
- Utilize both manual and automated testing methods for comprehensive coverage.

### Testing Strategy

#### 1. Manual Testing
- **Tools Used:** Jira and AIO Testing  
Manual testing was conducted for critical functionalities, with progress tracked and bugs logged in Jira. AIO Testing was utilized to create and manage manual test cases, facilitating effective management of test cases and ensuring thorough validation of all high-priority functionalities.

#### 2. Automated Testing
- **Tool Used:** Cypress  
Key workflows were automated to improve testing efficiency and consistency. Reports generated from Cypress were enhanced using **Allure** to provide detailed insights into test execution outcomes, including passed, failed, and skipped tests.

#### 3. API Testing
- **Tools Used:** Postman and Newman  
API testing involved capturing GET and POST requests using browser developer tools. Test scripts were written in Postman to validate API responses. Newman automated the execution of these tests, generating detailed reports.

#### 4. Performance Testing
- **Tool Used:** JMeter  
Load and stress tests were conducted to evaluate the platform's scalability. Reports from JMeter helped identify potential bottlenecks under high demand.

### Reports
Reports were generated for each testing tool, with Allure providing comprehensive reporting for Cypress tests. This helped ensure reliable operation of the admin account and informed decision-making for further development.

### Technologies Used
- **Jira** for manual testing and progress tracking
- **AIO Testing** for managing manual test cases
- **Cypress** for automated testing
- **Allure** for enhanced test reporting in Cypress
- **Postman** for API testing
- **Newman** for automating API tests and reporting
- **JMeter** for performance testing

### Conclusion
This project implemented a comprehensive testing approach to ensure that the ITC-College websiteâ€™s admin account operates reliably, supporting the platform's role in managing academic and administrative tasks effectively.
